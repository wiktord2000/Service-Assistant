# Service Assistance
The purpose of the engineering project was to design and implement a web application for small car service workshops. Currently available solutions often focus only on larger businesses, which ultimately means that smaller ones receive a too advanced tool that does not support their work, but rather complicates it.

The implemented application offered a simple user interface, instinctive associations between resources, and facilitated communication with the customer by sending e-mails without the need to use external mailboxes. Additionally, the application offers the ability to analyze collected data, which can be used to make strategic decisions by the company.

## How to run the application?
The application is hosted so you can just follow the given link:
https://serviceassistant.fly.dev

## Use cases

- Company login and registration
- Maintaining a database of services provided by the company
- Maintaining a database of car parts and accessories
- Issuing invoices for services performed in the service center **| not ready yet**
- Sending notifications to customers' email addresses (e.g. repair status updates)
- Reviewing statistics based on data collected by the application (e.g. most commonly repaired car make and year) **| partly implemented**
- Managing orders (creating, planning, and continuously updating information)
- Maintaining a customer profile (e.g. repair history, owned vehicles, contact information)
- Maintaining a vehicle profile (e.g. repair history, owner information, and basic vehicle information)

> **Note**<br/> 
> The main purpose was to create application mostly for desktops / large screens because of amount of data presented but progressively I'm working on responsiveness. I've recently provided better scalable tables and split the profiles to the desired form.<br/>
